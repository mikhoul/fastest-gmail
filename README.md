# Gmailâ„¢ Notifier Plus Ultra Light

*Forked from fastest-gmail for Chrome*

The easiest and lightest way to check Gmail from browser toolbar on Chrome

________________________________________________________________________________

I've made this fork since the original "fastest-gmail" seem abandonned. 

There was a lot of other Gmail checker in the Chrome store but most of them was to bloated for my taste.
I was using fastest-gmail with the old Firefox but the Opera version was not working and have many bugs.

Since I migated on Chromium I was in need for a lean alternative to manage my Gmail from the toolbar.

The main thing I've done is that I removed the fake UserAgent in the extension that was causing many problems.
